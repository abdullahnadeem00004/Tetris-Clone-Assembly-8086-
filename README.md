# 🛠️ Assembly Language Project

This repository contains an x86 Assembly program created as a part of the **Computer Organization and Assembly Language** course. 
The project focuses on applying core assembly language concepts using the TASM/MASM syntax and is aimed at enhancing understanding of low-level programming.

## 📌 Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to demonstrate:
- **Basic Input/Output operations**
- **Register usage and memory access**
- **Control flow implementation (loops, conditional branching)**
- **Working with different data types in Assembly**

The project helps to understand how computers execute instructions at the hardware level, and how memory and CPU registers interact during program execution.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **x86 Assembly Language**
- **TASM / MASM Assembler**
- **DOSBox or compatible emulator for execution**

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Install [DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com/) or use a compatible emulator.
2. Install TASM/MASM on the emulator.
3. Place the `.asm` file in the working directory.
4. Assemble and run the program using:
    ```
